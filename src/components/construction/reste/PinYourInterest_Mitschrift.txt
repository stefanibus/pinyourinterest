TASK DESCRIPTION 


What should be done
	- Contentful content types for user, post created
	- 4 users created, 20 posts created (entries)
	- Initiate the react project
	- Create a react app that uses that data on different routes
	- Link the project to github, set up collaborators
	the rest of the steps can be done in any order
	- install and import react-router-dom in App.js
	- Define 2 main routes (you can create more if you want to enhance your app) one route for allposts, the second for the best rated posts
	Steps required 
	- Create two view components, one will be responsible to display on /allposts the other on /bestratedposts

Objectives left
allposts view
	- fetch all posts entries (axios) and display them in a card like component. The user referenced in the post must be displayed in the card (firstname lastname for example)
	- create an input field, a submit button
	- on submit, fetch only the entries where the title contains the input text (https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/#/reference/search-parameters/full-text-search-on-a-field/query-entries/console)
	- update the state with the newly fetched entries

###############################################


Here is the work summed up until Wednesday and time repartition recommendations : 
Monday - Thursday : Full Focus on contentfull
Until next week : Focus on React

How to organise first tasks
- Create an organization, invite people to it
- Create a space on contentfull
- Create 2 different content types
- Create 20 entries of Post Content TYpe and 4 entries of User content type
 Remember each user needs a user reference so create user entries before Post 
:checkered_flag: At this point you will have configured your API, next is testing
 Testing : 
- Open up Postman ( this is a work required by everyone )
- Try fetching all posts
- Try fetching posts with a filter (using search tool form contentful documented here : https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/#/reference/search-parameters/full-text-search-on-a-field) Where the field has an example value you will chose
- Try fetching posts where the grade field value is 5 (using search operator again: https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/#/reference/search-parameters/full-text-search )
This is the checklist you need for wednesday evening :
- Organisation, Space setup 
- 2 Content types available : User, Post
- 4 User entries, 20 Posts inserted
- Everyone tested endpoints for fetching all posts, all posts with a filtered term, a rating of 5
Content type example
# User
firstname : text
lastname : text
email : text
# Post
title : text
description : text
image : media
userRef : Reference to a User entry
rating : integer from 0 to 5
